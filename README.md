# LMP1210_RegionalClassifier
We aim to train a regional classifier for glioblastoma to better decipher its spatial complexity and understand tumor microenviornment. 
For the purpose of the assignment, we trained XGBoost using Google Colab gpu to speed up the training process. See here for all the scripts for XGBoost: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11tbNWcbmLz-U4KcR4WEOcHnEbSf8ivI7?usp=sharing. This repository harbors all of the scripts for random forest and Multi-layer Perceptron.
